# Naval Postgraduate School Blockchain Project (Summer 2020)
## Project Description
Created a Blockchain network with peer nodes and associated smart contracts in order to demo how the Department of Navy can use Blockchain to facilitate food, medical equipment, and other types of shipments from producers (contractors) to bases, using checkpoint managers.

## Smart Contracts
Used Typescript and the IBM Blockchain Platform, which uses the Kubernetes cluster and Hyperledger Fabric framework, to create protocols for tracking shipments using RFIDs. This smart contract allows each peer node in the network to maintain an accurate, streamlined ledger of "transactions" that occur and are approved by the consensus algorithm.
